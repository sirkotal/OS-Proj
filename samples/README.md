## Problem #1

Write a program ***samples*** that given **one text file and two integers, n and m**, on
the command line, **prints a sequence of n text fragments, each with m characters from the
original file. Fragments must be obtained in n different positions** in the file at random and
be written sequentially in stdout without any separator or line change, and between > and
< characters.
